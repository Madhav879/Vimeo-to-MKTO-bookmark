### Overview üåü
The Vimeo to Marketo is a tool designed to simplify the process of extracting and modifying Vimeo video URLs from a webpage. This tool is particularly useful for embedding Vimeo videos into Marketo landing pages by automatically reformatting the extracted URLs into the format required for Marketo LPs.

### Purpose üéØ
In many cases, videos hosted on Vimeo need to be embedded in MKTO landing pages. To do this, the original Vimeo video URL, embedded on a resource page, needs to be extracted and altered into a specific URL structure. Manually performing this task can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The tool automates this process, ensuring efficiency and accuracy

### Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è
 1. The tool scans the webpage to find any Vimeo video URLs embedded in the HTML, specifically those starting with the format <br>
 `` https://player.vimeo.com/video/{videoid}?h={hash} ``

 2. Once the Vimeo URLs are identified, the tool extracts the relevant components (the videoid and hash) and converts the URL into the format that can be used in MKTO LPs
 ``https://cdn.blueyonder.com/global/video.html?videoid={videoid}/{hash} ``
